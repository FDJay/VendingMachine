# VendingMachine

This is a project where I incorporated HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, 
and REST APIs by building a dynamic user-interface consuming a REST API.

The overall concept is a vitutual Vending Machine where JSON data is being retrived and displayed. 
Users can purchase any desired item and its easy to use with the buttons provided on the right side of the screen.
